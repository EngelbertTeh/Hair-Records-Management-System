        leaving jokes all over the place: under the kings pillow, in his soup,

      <div className="my-[0.5px] ">
        even in the royal toilet. The king was furious, but he couldnt seem to

      <div className="my-[0.5px] ">
        stop Jokester. And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered

        that the jokes left by Jokester were so funny that they couldnt help but

        laugh. And once they started laughing, they couldnt stop.
